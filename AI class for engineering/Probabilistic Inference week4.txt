#Probabilistic Inference

## Varibles
	Evidence varibles
	Query varibles
	hidden varibles
## Methods to speed up when there is too many varibles
	1. Pulling out terms
	2. maximize independence
	3. varible elimination
	   ¢Ù joining factors
	   ¢Ú Approximate Inference£ºrejection samples
	   ¢Û likelihood weighting
	   ¢Ü gibbs sampling
